# PromptLib
## About
A WIP collection of refined, value-dense, novel and/or exceptional prompts for large language models (particularly ChatGPT for now).

Many are projects in and of themselves — natural language programs for which ChatGPT serves as a decent frontend. Prompts are generally structured in what is starting to turn into a standardized format; more on this later.

## Context
The best of the best LLMs and their associated interfaces like ChatGPT do a decent-to-excellent job of performing basic or complex tasks when given simple question/instruction, but outputs can often be lackluster. 

A public perception I've observed to be forming around these tools is that their lackluster outputs are representative of a low quality in the underlying models. This project seeks to demonstrate that this isn't the case: **the quality and presentation** of the natural (and sometimes not-so-natural) language fed to a model directly influences the quality of its outputs.

We're only just beginning to tap into the potential of even the currently available iterations of GPT-3 (and its incarnation as ChatGPT), let alone the more powerful models to come, e.g. [whatever's powering Bing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned?commentId=AAC8jKeDp6xqsZK2K).

Effectively, most of the prompts in this library are natural-language programs (both in their literal/written structure and in the scale & exponential value of their outputs when operated effectively) which act upon concepts and data, represented as text.

I'm currently working on the prompts themselves in my spare time, along with eventual documentation for each prompt, along with the library as a whole. The project serves as a base for tools & utilities to be built out over time for developers, knowledge workers and the general public.
