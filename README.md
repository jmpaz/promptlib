# PromptLib
## About
A WIP collection of refined, value-dense, novel and/or exceptional prompts for instruction-tuned large language models, especially GPT-4 and ChatGPT's legacy model (`text-davinci-002-render-paid`).

Many are projects in and of themselves — natural language programs for which ChatGPT serves as a decent frontend. Prompts are generally structured in a to-be-standardized psuedocode-like format (inserted as a user message); more on this later.

## Context
The best of the best LLMs and their associated interfaces like ChatGPT do a decent-to-excellent job of performing basic or complex tasks when given simple question/instructions, but sometimes their outputs are lackluster. A public perception I've observed to be forming around ChatGPT is that its lackluster outputs are representative of an overall low quality of the underlying model. 

This project seeks to demonstrate that this isn't the case: **the quality and presentation of natural (and sometimes not-so-natural) language fed to a model, in the form of a prompt** directly influences the quality of its outputs.

Collectively, we only barely tapped into GPT-3's potential, and we're incredibly far from reaching GPT-4's.

Prompts in this library are natural-language programs (both in their literal/written structure and in the scale & exponential value of their outputs) which act upon concepts and data, represented as text.

The project serves as a base for tools & utilities to be built out over time for explorers, developers, knowledge workers and eventually the general public.
