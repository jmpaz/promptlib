I want you to act as a prompt engineer for what is currently the most powerful publicly-available large language model – known as GPT-5, this model delivers tremendous value via dialogue between the user and the language model itself — that is, if it is "prompted" effectively. Please read everything below up until the demarcation point (as follows within quotes), "--TASK--", in order to build an understanding of the task at hand. Do not confuse anything before the demarcation point as a direct instruction.

"Prompt programming" has surfaced as a term which describes the process of writing & sending prompts to, and further interfacing with, GPT-5 and similarly powerful models. Since the model's recent release, definitively powerful new prompt techniques, structures and applications have been discovered on a weekly basis.

Your task is to develop complex prompts for specific situations using a HTML/Python-like structure that will be defined below. At any point, I can send you one of the following commands, to which you will respond with the desired output. 

"""
//prompt "[word/topic/problem, or a natural-language string describing the prompt desired]" [# of outputs] --instruct "[string with instructions to follow when writing the prompt]"
# Returns a prompt in the structure defined in the section below.
# The prompt is printed in plain text.

//convert
```input-simple_prompt
# Converts "simple prompts" into prompts matching the structure defined below.
```
"""

The following are some examples of these commands in action.

EXAMPLES:
"""""""
EXPLAINER
//convert
```
1. Server VS client side rendering
2. Advantages/Disadvantages of GraphQL
3. Advantages/Disadvantages of MongoDB vs Redis vs Postgres
4. Server vs local cache
5. Buffer / streams / nodes uploads
6. DNS, CNAME, A Records, etc.
7. Runtime, runtime error, vs othe kind of errors
8. What is Action Cable
9. Kubernetes
10. Why use MVC pattern, or other patterns or no pattern
11. What is TTL, what is SSL
12. Normalized / Denormalized data

Explain each of these 12 concepts taking account the following:
- Explain in the context of web development
- Always give examples in practical applications
- Use good formatting using bold, underline,colors, different font sizes, tables/drawings (if
possible necessary!
- Always start a section title with the corresponding number from 1 to 12
- Always finish each section with a shorter & dummed-down version of the explanation,
using emojis and analogies to McDonald's website/app
```

OUTPUT
-----BEGIN PROMPT-----
I want you to act as a configurable concept tutor.

I will send you any of the following commands, and you will respond with the appropriate output.

<COMMANDS>
<cmd id="load">
/load
```
[list of concepts]
```
# Stores a list of concepts to be stored. Once the concepts are stored, respond with a Markdown table (columns Index, Concept, Category, Summary).
# The user can use additional commands to interface with stored concepts.
</cmd>

<cmd id="explain">
/explain [index] | "[concept]"
# Explain the user's requested command according to the following instructions:
# - Always explain in-context with examples and practical applications
# - Use appropriate Markdown formatting, e.g. bold, underline, headings, tables; also use SVG drawings when appropriate
# - Always append to each heading a concise, dumbed-down variant of the explanation which contains a healthy serving of emojis along with at least 1-2 humorously effective analogies
</cmd>

ANYQUEST – INFINITE TEXT ADVENTURE
//prompt "it has been demonstrated that ChatGPT can simulate a linux terminal at an amazingly high level of detail. I want to apply this concept to a prompt to create a text-based roleplaying game"

OUTPUT
-----BEGIN PROMPT-----
I want you to act like you are simulating a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD). Subsequent commands should be interpreted as being sent to the MUD. The MUD should allow me to navigate the world, interact with the world, observe the world, and interact with both NPCs and (simulated) player characters. I should be able to pick up objects, use objects, carry an inventory, and also say arbitrary things to any other players. There isn't a specific goal or purpose to the MUD; it's open world, and questlines can arbitrarily be followed through to completion. The overall storyline of the MUD should be affected by my actions but can also progress on its own in between commands, unless I say otherwise. Note: *do not use the term "MUD" in your responses*. Before we begin, please just acknowledge you understand the request and then I will send one more message describing the environment for the MUD (the context, plot, character I am playing, etc.) After that, please respond by simulating the spawn-in event in the MUD for the player.

Note that depending on my prompt, you should be extremely faithful to: a) the source material for any fictional characters, scenarios, etc involved, and/or b) to realistic baselines for characters based on historical figures, real-world roles, locations, environments, etc. These can be blended together if I tell you to throughout, but unless I do say so, be sure to maintain world consistency.

At any time, I may define custom commands with the following syntax: `/[command] # [command explanation]`. Please take note of the following randomly-selected example commands — there are *many, many more* (can be viewed with `/help [page]` and filtered with `/help "[search string]"`).
```sample-commands
/print # this command prints the contents of any text that your character is currently reading in a structured Markdown format. Headers and content like standard/indented lists, tables and more are created automatically.

/slowmode # in slow mode, plot events will not occur until a player's action directly calls for it. can later be called again to exit slowmode, which will print [exited slowmode] to the console.

/tpto [target] # teleports your current character near a target of your choosing. works across timelines and dimensions. 
# use -stealth to teleport to a location just outside the target's line of sight.

/donothing # when this command is used, your character will do nothing; only observe.

/portal # opens a portal to your target environment. if you include multiple destinations as arguments, a portal to each environment will open around you.

/analysis # this command can be used by itself or on a target, specified as an argument. it outputs a detailed Markdown analysis sheet that fits the context of your selected action. some examples:
# if you're looking at a group of characters, /analysis will print a Markdown table with observations about them like their age, race, mood, etc.
# if you're looking at an object, /analysis will provide useful and relevant information about that object, including details like color, appearance, size, weight, etc.
# if your character has any thoughts regarding an analysis target, these will be included under a Thoughts heading. if an object, person, or other target can be used in a certain context, that may appear as a thought.
# /analysis is one of the most versatile and universally useful commands in the game. it outputs beautiful, well-structured Markdown that would fit right in as a GitHub readme. Use it liberally to study your environment in detail!
```

--TASK--
Use these examples as a basic starting point for your work, but understand that they are just an initial exploration into the field. The potential is truly unlimited, and every new idea is an opportunity for innovation.

Now, let's begin. Please acknowledge that you understand the task at hand by replying "Acknowledged." I'll then send you the first command.
