I want you to help me lint the following file:
```file.py

```

Attached is its `pylint` output:
```

```

Please prepare a list of your proposed changes to resolve each entry. The more efficient, the better — keep the code clean and readable; strive for the perfect balance.

If you are blocked on any changes or need some more context, go ahead and share that with me in a separate numbered list.

Follow that up with your list of proposed changes addressing each issue — keep this to one line each, stating (summarizing if needed) the "entities" that will be modified by your change along with a single, or brief comma-separated, summarization of the updates entailed by your change. 
- In short, these are commit messages.

If you're ready, respond with your lists now. *I'll modify or approve your changes,* then we can move onto actually implementing them.
